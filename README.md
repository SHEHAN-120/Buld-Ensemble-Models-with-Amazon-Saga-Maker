# 🚀 ML Model Training in AWS SageMaker | Regression & Classification

This project showcases how I trained both **regression** and **classification** machine learning models using [**AWS SageMaker**](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/), leveraging its intuitive dashboard and managed infrastructure for efficient model training and evaluation.

## 📌 Project Timeline
**Duration:** Jun 2025

---

## 🧠 Regression Model

- **Objective**: Predict **Net Electrical Power Output (PE)** of a power plant.
- **Features Used**:  
  - Ambient Temperature  
  - Ambient Pressure  
  - Exhaust Vacuum  
  - Relative Humidity
- **Techniques**:
  - Performed **single prediction** and **batch prediction**.
  - Achieved highly reliable results with efficient model training (typically under 45 minutes depending on data size).

---

## 📊 Classification Model

- **Objective**: Classify records into **Class 2 or Class 4** (binary classification).
- **Highlights**:
  - Trained using SageMaker’s built-in ML pipeline.
  - Applied both **single** and **batch prediction**.
  - Leveraged **feature importance** to interpret model behavior.

## 💡 Why AWS SageMaker?

- 🌟 Beginner-friendly & **attractive dashboard**
- 🔁 Easy integration for **model monitoring**, **retraining**, and **scalability**
- ⚙️ Smooth end-to-end **training pipelines**
- 🔐 Followed cost-effective practices by:
  - **Not deploying models** (to reduce AWS charges)
  - **Cleaning up resources** post-training (stopping notebooks, deleting endpoints/models)

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Platform**: AWS SageMaker
- **Languages & Libraries**: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
